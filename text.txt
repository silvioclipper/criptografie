A FEW WORDS ABOUT DOSTOEVSKY HIMSELF MAY HELP THE ENGLISH READER TO
UNDERSTAND HIS WORK
DOSTOEVSKY WAS THE SON OF A DOCTOR HIS PARENTS WERE VERY HARD WORKING
AND DEEPLY RELIGIOUS PEOPLE BUT SO POOR THAT THEY LIVED WITH THEIR FIVE
CHILDREN IN ONLY TWO ROOMS THE FATHER AND MOTHER SPENT THEIR EVENINGS
IN READING ALOUD TO THEIR CHILDREN GENERALLY FROM BOOKS OF A SERIOUS
CHARACTER THOUGH ALWAYS SICKLY AND DELICATE DOSTOEVSKY CAME OUT THIRD IN THE
FINAL EXAMINATION OF THE PETERSBURG SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING THERE HE HAD
ALREADY BEGUN HIS FIRST WORK POOR FOLK
THIS STORY WAS PUBLISHED BY THE POET NEKRASSOV IN HIS REVIEW AND
WAS RECEIVED WITH ACCLAMATIONS THE SHY UNKNOWN YOUTH FOUND HIMSELF
INSTANTLY SOMETHING OF A CELEBRITY A BRILLIANT AND SUCCESSFUL CAREER
SEEMED TO OPEN BEFORE HIM BUT THOSE HOPES WERE SOON DASHED IN  HE
WAS ARRESTED THOUGH NEITHER BY TEMPERAMENT NOR CONVICTION A REVOLUTIONIST DOSTOEVSKY
WAS ONE OF A LITTLE GROUP OF YOUNG MEN WHO MET TOGETHER TO READ FOURIER
AND PROUDHON HE WAS ACCUSED OF TAKING PART IN CONVERSATIONS AGAINST
THE CENSORSHIP OF READING A LETTER FROM BYELINSKY TO GOGOL AND OF
KNOWING OF THE INTENTION TO SET UP A PRINTING PRESS UNDER NICHOLAS
I THAT STERN AND JUST MAN AS MAURICE BARING CALLS HIM THIS WAS
ENOUGH AND HE WAS CONDEMNED TO DEATH AFTER EIGHT MONTHS IMPRISONMENT
HE WAS WITH TWENTY ONE OTHERS TAKEN OUT TO THE SEMYONOVSKY SQUARE TO
BE SHOT WRITING TO HIS BROTHER MIHAIL DOSTOEVSKY SAYS THEY SNAPPED
WORDS OVER OUR HEADS AND THEY MADE US PUT ON THE WHITE SHIRTS WORN BY
PERSONS CONDEMNED TO DEATH THEREUPON WE WERE BOUND IN THREES TO STAKES
TO SUFFER EXECUTION BEING THE THIRD IN THE ROW I CONCLUDED I HAD ONLY
A FEW MINUTES OF LIFE BEFORE ME I THOUGHT OF YOU AND YOUR DEAR ONES AND
I CONTRIVED TO KISS PLESTCHEIEV AND DOUROV WHO WERE NEXT TO ME AND TO
BID THEM FAREWELL SUDDENLY THE TROOPS BEAT A TATTOO WE WERE UNBOUND
BROUGHT BACK UPON THE SCAFFOLD AND INFORMED THAT HIS MAJESTY HAD SPARED
US OUR LIVES THE SENTENCE WAS COMMUTED TO HARD LABOUR ONE OF THE PRISONERS GRIGORYEV WENT MAD AS SOON AS HE WAS UNTIED AND
NEVER REGAINED HIS SANITY THE INTENSE SUFFERING OF THIS EXPERIENCE LEFT A LASTING STAMP ON DOSTOEVSKYS MIND THOUGH HIS RELIGIOUS TEMPER LED HIM IN THE END TO
ACCEPT EVERY SUFFERING WITH RESIGNATION AND TO REGARD IT AS A BLESSING
IN HIS OWN CASE HE CONSTANTLY RECURS TO THE SUBJECT IN HIS WRITINGS
HE DESCRIBES THE AWFUL AGONY OF THE CONDEMNED MAN AND INSISTS ON THE
CRUELTY OF INFLICTING SUCH TORTURE THEN FOLLOWED FOUR YEARS OF PENAL
SERVITUDE SPENT IN THE COMPANY OF COMMON CRIMINALS IN SIBERIA WHERE
HE BEGAN THE DEAD HOUSE AND SOME YEARS OF SERVICE IN A DISCIPLINARY
BATTALION HE HAD SHOWN SIGNS OF SOME OBSCURE NERVOUS DISEASE BEFORE HIS ARREST
AND THIS NOW DEVELOPED INTO VIOLENT ATTACKS OF EPILEPSY FROM WHICH HE
SUFFERED FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE THE FITS OCCURRED THREE OR FOUR TIMES
A YEAR AND WERE MORE FREQUENT IN PERIODS OF GREAT STRAIN IN  HE WAS
ALLOWED TO RETURN TO RUSSIA HE STARTED A JOURNALVREMYA WHICH WAS
FORBIDDEN BY THE CENSORSHIP THROUGH A MISUNDERSTANDING IN  HE LOST
HIS FIRST WIFE AND HIS BROTHER MIHAIL HE WAS IN TERRIBLE POVERTY YET
HE TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE PAYMENT OF HIS BROTHERS DEBTS HE STARTED
ANOTHER JOURNALTHE EPOCH WHICH WITHIN A FEW MONTHS WAS ALSO
PROHIBITED HE WAS WEIGHED DOWN BY DEBT HIS BROTHERS FAMILY WAS
DEPENDENT ON HIM HE WAS FORCED TO WRITE AT HEART BREAKING SPEED AND IS
SAID NEVER TO HAVE CORRECTED HIS WORK THE LATER YEARS OF HIS LIFE WERE
MUCH SOFTENED BY THE TENDERNESS AND DEVOTION OF HIS SECOND WIFE IN JUNE  HE MADE HIS FAMOUS SPEECH AT THE UNVEILING OF THE MONUMENT TO PUSHKIN IN MOSCOW AND HE WAS RECEIVED WITH EXTRAORDINARY
DEMONSTRATIONS OF LOVE AND HONOUR A FEW MONTHS LATER DOSTOEVSKY DIED HE WAS FOLLOWED TO THE GRAVE BY A
VAST MULTITUDE OF MOURNERS WHO GAVE THE HAPLESS MAN THE FUNERAL OF A
KING HE IS STILL PROBABLY THE MOST WIDELY READ WRITER IN RUSSIA
IN THE WORDS OF A RUSSIAN CRITIC WHO SEEKS TO EXPLAIN THE FEELING
INSPIRED BY DOSTOEVSKY HE WAS ONE OF OURSELVES A MAN OF OUR BLOOD AND
OUR BONE BUT ONE WHO HAS SUFFERED AND HAS SEEN SO MUCH MORE DEEPLY THAN
WE HAVE HIS INSIGHT IMPRESSES US AS WISDOM THAT WISDOM OF THE HEART
WHICH WE SEEK THAT WE MAY LEARN FROM IT HOW TO LIVE ALL HIS OTHER
GIFTS CAME TO HIM FROM NATURE THIS HE WON FOR HIMSELF AND THROUGH IT HE
BECAME GREAT
ON AN EXCEPTIONALLY HOT EVENING EARLY IN JULY A YOUNG MAN CAME OUT OF
THE GARRET IN WHICH HE LODGED IN S PLACE AND WALKED SLOWLY AS THOUGH
IN HESITATION TOWARDS K BRIDGE

HE HAD SUCCESSFULLY AVOIDED MEETING HIS LANDLADY ON THE STAIRCASE HIS
GARRET WAS UNDER THE ROOF OF A HIGH FIVE STORIED HOUSE AND WAS MORE
LIKE A CUPBOARD THAN A ROOM THE LANDLADY WHO PROVIDED HIM WITH GARRET
DINNERS AND ATTENDANCE LIVED ON THE FLOOR BELOW AND EVERY TIME
HE WENT OUT HE WAS OBLIGED TO PASS HER KITCHEN THE DOOR OF WHICH
INVARIABLY STOOD OPEN AND EACH TIME HE PASSED THE YOUNG MAN HAD A
SICK FRIGHTENED FEELING WHICH MADE HIM SCOWL AND FEEL ASHAMED HE WAS
HOPELESSLY IN DEBT TO HIS LANDLADY AND WAS AFRAID OF MEETING HER

THIS WAS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS COWARDLY AND ABJECT QUITE THE CONTRARY  BUT
FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN IN AN OVERSTRAINED IRRITABLE CONDITION
VERGING ON HYPOCHONDRIA HE HAD BECOME SO COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN
HIMSELF AND ISOLATED FROM HIS FELLOWS THAT HE DREADED MEETING NOT
ONLY HIS LANDLADY BUT ANYONE AT ALL HE WAS CRUSHED BY POVERTY BUT THE
ANXIETIES OF HIS POSITION HAD OF LATE CEASED TO WEIGH UPON HIM HE HAD
GIVEN UP ATTENDING TO MATTERS OF PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE  HE HAD LOST ALL
DESIRE TO DO SO NOTHING THAT ANY LANDLADY COULD DO HAD A REAL TERROR
FOR HIM BUT TO BE STOPPED ON THE STAIRS TO BE FORCED TO LISTEN TO HER
TRIVIAL IRRELEVANT GOSSIP TO PESTERING DEMANDS FOR PAYMENT THREATS
AND COMPLAINTS AND TO RACK HIS BRAINS FOR EXCUSES TO PREVARICATE TO
LIE  NO RATHER THAN THAT HE WOULD CREEP DOWN THE STAIRS LIKE A CAT AND
SLIP OUT UNSEEN

THIS EVENING HOWEVER ON COMING OUT INTO THE STREET HE BECAME ACUTELY
AWARE OF HIS FEARS

I WANT TO ATTEMPT A THING LIKE THAT AND AM FRIGHTENED BY THESE
TRIFLES HE THOUGHT WITH AN ODD SMILE HM YES ALL IS IN A MANS
HANDS AND HE LETS IT ALL SLIP FROM COWARDICE THATS AN AXIOM IT WOULD
BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHAT IT IS MEN ARE MOST AFRAID OF TAKING A NEW
STEP UTTERING A NEW WORD IS WHAT THEY FEAR MOST BUT I AM TALKING
TOO MUCH ITS BECAUSE I CHATTER THAT I DO NOTHING OR PERHAPS IT IS
THAT I CHATTER BECAUSE I DO NOTHING IVE LEARNED TO CHATTER THIS
LAST MONTH LYING FOR DAYS TOGETHER IN MY DEN THINKING OF JACK THE
GIANT KILLER WHY AM I GOING THERE NOW AM I CAPABLE OF THAT IS
THAT SERIOUS IT IS NOT SERIOUS AT ALL ITS SIMPLY A FANTASY TO AMUSE
MYSELF  A PLAYTHING YES MAYBE IT IS A PLAYTHING

THE HEAT IN THE STREET WAS TERRIBLE AND THE AIRLESSNESS THE BUSTLE
AND THE PLASTER SCAFFOLDING BRICKS AND DUST ALL ABOUT HIM AND THAT
SPECIAL PETERSBURG STENCH SO FAMILIAR TO ALL WHO ARE UNABLE TO GET OUT
OF TOWN IN SUMMER  ALL WORKED PAINFULLY UPON THE YOUNG MANS ALREADY
OVERWROUGHT NERVES THE INSUFFERABLE STENCH FROM THE POT HOUSES WHICH
ARE PARTICULARLY NUMEROUS IN THAT PART OF THE TOWN AND THE DRUNKEN MEN
WHOM HE MET CONTINUALLY ALTHOUGH IT WAS A WORKING DAY COMPLETED
THE REVOLTING MISERY OF THE PICTURE AN EXPRESSION OF THE PROFOUNDEST
DISGUST GLEAMED FOR A MOMENT IN THE YOUNG MANS REFINED FACE HE WAS
BY THE WAY EXCEPTIONALLY HANDSOME ABOVE THE AVERAGE IN HEIGHT SLIM
WELL BUILT WITH BEAUTIFUL DARK EYES AND DARK BROWN HAIR SOON HE SANK
INTO DEEP THOUGHT OR MORE ACCURATELY SPEAKING INTO A COMPLETE BLANKNESS
OF MIND  HE WALKED ALONG NOT OBSERVING WHAT WAS ABOUT HIM AND NOT CARING
TO OBSERVE IT FROM TIME TO TIME HE WOULD MUTTER SOMETHING FROM THE
HABIT OF TALKING TO HIMSELF TO WHICH HE HAD JUST CONFESSED AT THESE
MOMENTS HE WOULD BECOME CONSCIOUS THAT HIS IDEAS WERE SOMETIMES IN A
TANGLE AND THAT HE WAS VERY WEAK  FOR TWO DAYS HE HAD SCARCELY TASTED
FOOD

HE WAS SO BADLY DRESSED THAT EVEN A MAN ACCUSTOMED TO SHABBINESS WOULD
HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO BE SEEN IN THE STREET IN SUCH RAGS IN THAT QUARTER
OF THE TOWN HOWEVER SCARCELY ANY SHORTCOMING IN DRESS WOULD HAVE
CREATED SURPRISE OWING TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE HAY MARKET THE NUMBER
OF ESTABLISHMENTS OF BAD CHARACTER THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE TRADING
AND WORKING CLASS POPULATION CROWDED IN THESE STREETS AND ALLEYS IN THE
HEART OF PETERSBURG TYPES SO VARIOUS WERE TO BE SEEN IN THE STREETS
THAT NO FIGURE HOWEVER QUEER WOULD HAVE CAUSED SURPRISE BUT THERE WAS
SUCH ACCUMULATED BITTERNESS AND CONTEMPT IN THE YOUNG MANS HEART THAT
IN SPITE OF ALL THE FASTIDIOUSNESS OF YOUTH HE MINDED HIS RAGS LEAST
OF ALL IN THE STREET IT WAS A DIFFERENT MATTER WHEN HE MET WITH
ACQUAINTANCES OR WITH FORMER FELLOW STUDENTS WHOM INDEED HE DISLIKED
MEETING AT ANY TIME AND YET WHEN A DRUNKEN MAN WHO FOR SOME UNKNOWN
REASON WAS BEING TAKEN SOMEWHERE IN A HUGE WAGGON DRAGGED BY A HEAVY
DRAY HORSE SUDDENLY SHOUTED AT HIM AS HE DROVE PAST HEY THERE GERMAN
HATTER BAWLING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE AND POINTING AT HIM  THE YOUNG
MAN STOPPED SUDDENLY AND CLUTCHED TREMULOUSLY AT HIS HAT IT WAS A TALL
ROUND HAT FROM ZIMMERMANS BUT COMPLETELY WORN OUT RUSTY WITH AGE ALL
TORN AND BESPATTERED BRIMLESS AND BENT ON ONE SIDE IN A MOST UNSEEMLY
FASHION NOT SHAME HOWEVER BUT QUITE ANOTHER FEELING AKIN TO TERROR
HAD OVERTAKEN HIM

I KNEW IT HE MUTTERED IN CONFUSION I THOUGHT SO THATS THE WORST
OF ALL WHY A STUPID THING LIKE THIS THE MOST TRIVIAL DETAIL MIGHT
SPOIL THE WHOLE PLAN YES MY HAT IS TOO NOTICEABLE IT LOOKS ABSURD
AND THAT MAKES IT NOTICEABLE WITH MY RAGS I OUGHT TO WEAR A CAP ANY
SORT OF OLD PANCAKE BUT NOT THIS GROTESQUE THING NOBODY WEARS SUCH
A HAT IT WOULD BE NOTICED A MILE OFF IT WOULD BE REMEMBERED WHAT
MATTERS IS THAT PEOPLE WOULD REMEMBER IT AND THAT WOULD GIVE THEM
A CLUE FOR THIS BUSINESS ONE SHOULD BE AS LITTLE CONSPICUOUS AS
POSSIBLE TRIFLES TRIFLES ARE WHAT MATTER WHY ITS JUST SUCH
TRIFLES THAT ALWAYS RUIN EVERYTHING

HE HAD NOT FAR TO GO  HE KNEW INDEED HOW MANY STEPS IT WAS FROM THE GATE
OF HIS LODGING HOUSE EXACTLY SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY HE HAD COUNTED
THEM ONCE WHEN HE HAD BEEN LOST IN DREAMS AT THE TIME HE HAD PUT NO
FAITH IN THOSE DREAMS AND WAS ONLY TANTALISING HIMSELF BY THEIR HIDEOUS
BUT DARING RECKLESSNESS NOW A MONTH LATER HE HAD BEGUN TO LOOK UPON
THEM DIFFERENTLY AND IN SPITE OF THE MONOLOGUES IN WHICH HE JEERED AT
HIS OWN IMPOTENCE AND INDECISION HE HAD INVOLUNTARILY COME TO REGARD
THIS HIDEOUS DREAM AS AN EXPLOIT TO BE ATTEMPTED ALTHOUGH HE
STILL DID NOT REALISE THIS HIMSELF HE WAS POSITIVELY GOING NOW FOR A
REHEARSAL OF HIS PROJECT AND AT EVERY STEP HIS EXCITEMENT GREW MORE
AND MORE VIOLENT

WITH A SINKING HEART AND A NERVOUS TREMOR HE WENT UP TO A HUGE HOUSE
WHICH ON ONE SIDE LOOKED ON TO THE CANAL AND ON THE OTHER INTO THE
STREET THIS HOUSE WAS LET OUT IN TINY TENEMENTS AND WAS INHABITED BY
WORKING PEOPLE OF ALL KINDS  TAILORS LOCKSMITHS COOKS GERMANS OF
SORTS GIRLS PICKING UP A LIVING AS BEST THEY COULD PETTY CLERKS ETC
THERE WAS A CONTINUAL COMING AND GOING THROUGH THE TWO GATES AND IN THE
TWO COURTYARDS OF THE HOUSE THREE OR FOUR DOOR KEEPERS WERE EMPLOYED ON
THE BUILDING THE YOUNG MAN WAS VERY GLAD TO MEET NONE OF THEM AND
AT ONCE SLIPPED UNNOTICED THROUGH THE DOOR ON THE RIGHT AND UP THE
STAIRCASE IT WAS A BACK STAIRCASE DARK AND NARROW BUT HE WAS FAMILIAR
WITH IT ALREADY AND KNEW HIS WAY AND HE LIKED ALL THESE SURROUNDINGS
IN SUCH DARKNESS EVEN THE MOST INQUISITIVE EYES WERE NOT TO BE DREADED

IF I AM SO SCARED NOW WHAT WOULD IT BE IF IT SOMEHOW CAME TO PASS THAT
I WERE REALLY GOING TO DO IT HE COULD NOT HELP ASKING HIMSELF AS HE
REACHED THE FOURTH STOREY THERE HIS PROGRESS WAS BARRED BY SOME PORTERS
WHO WERE ENGAGED IN MOVING FURNITURE OUT OF A FLAT HE KNEW THAT THE
FLAT HAD BEEN OCCUPIED BY A GERMAN CLERK IN THE CIVIL SERVICE AND HIS
FAMILY THIS GERMAN WAS MOVING OUT THEN AND SO THE FOURTH FLOOR ON THIS
STAIRCASE WOULD BE UNTENANTED EXCEPT BY THE OLD WOMAN THATS A GOOD
THING ANYWAY HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF AS HE RANG THE BELL OF THE OLD
WOMANS FLAT THE BELL GAVE A FAINT TINKLE AS THOUGH IT WERE MADE OF
TIN AND NOT OF COPPER THE LITTLE FLATS IN SUCH HOUSES ALWAYS HAVE BELLS
THAT RING LIKE THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE NOTE OF THAT BELL AND NOW
ITS PECULIAR TINKLE SEEMED TO REMIND HIM OF SOMETHING AND TO BRING IT
CLEARLY BEFORE HIM HE STARTED HIS NERVES WERE TERRIBLY OVERSTRAINED
BY NOW IN A LITTLE WHILE THE DOOR WAS OPENED A TINY CRACK THE OLD
WOMAN EYED HER VISITOR WITH EVIDENT DISTRUST THROUGH THE CRACK AND
NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT HER LITTLE EYES GLITTERING IN THE DARKNESS
BUT SEEING A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ON THE LANDING SHE GREW BOLDER AND
OPENED THE DOOR WIDE THE YOUNG MAN STEPPED INTO THE DARK ENTRY WHICH
WAS PARTITIONED OFF FROM THE TINY KITCHEN THE OLD WOMAN STOOD FACING
HIM IN SILENCE AND LOOKING INQUIRINGLY AT HIM SHE WAS A DIMINUTIVE
WITHERED UP OLD WOMAN OF SIXTY WITH SHARP MALIGNANT EYES AND A SHARP
LITTLE NOSE HER COLOURLESS SOMEWHAT GRIZZLED HAIR WAS THICKLY SMEARED
WITH OIL AND SHE WORE NO KERCHIEF OVER IT ROUND HER THIN LONG NECK
WHICH LOOKED LIKE A HENS LEG WAS KNOTTED SOME SORT OF FLANNEL RAG
AND IN SPITE OF THE HEAT THERE HUNG FLAPPING ON HER SHOULDERS A MANGY
FUR CAPE YELLOW WITH AGE THE OLD WOMAN COUGHED AND GROANED AT EVERY
INSTANT THE YOUNG MAN MUST HAVE LOOKED AT HER WITH A RATHER PECULIAR
EXPRESSION FOR A GLEAM OF MISTRUST CAME INTO HER EYES AGAIN

RASKOLNIKOV A STUDENT I CAME HERE A MONTH AGO THE YOUNG MAN MADE
HASTE TO MUTTER WITH A HALF BOW REMEMBERING THAT HE OUGHT TO BE MORE
POLITE

I REMEMBER MY GOOD SIR I REMEMBER QUITE WELL YOUR COMING HERE THE
OLD WOMAN SAID DISTINCTLY STILL KEEPING HER INQUIRING EYES ON HIS FACE

AND HERE I AM AGAIN ON THE SAME ERRAND RASKOLNIKOV CONTINUED A
LITTLE DISCONCERTED AND SURPRISED AT THE OLD WOMANS MISTRUST PERHAPS
SHE IS ALWAYS LIKE THAT THOUGH ONLY I DID NOT NOTICE IT THE OTHER
TIME HE THOUGHT WITH AN UNEASY FEELING

THE OLD WOMAN PAUSED AS THOUGH HESITATING  THEN STEPPED ON ONE SIDE
AND POINTING TO THE DOOR OF THE ROOM SHE SAID LETTING HER VISITOR PASS
IN FRONT OF HER

STEP IN MY GOOD SIR

THE LITTLE ROOM INTO WHICH THE YOUNG MAN WALKED WITH YELLOW PAPER ON
THE WALLS GERANIUMS AND MUSLIN CURTAINS IN THE WINDOWS WAS BRIGHTLY
LIGHTED UP AT THAT MOMENT BY THE SETTING SUN

SO THE SUN WILL SHINE LIKE THIS THEN TOO FLASHED AS IT WERE BY
CHANCE THROUGH RASKOLNIKOVS MIND AND WITH A RAPID GLANCE HE SCANNED
EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM TRYING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO NOTICE AND
REMEMBER ITS ARRANGEMENT BUT THERE WAS NOTHING SPECIAL IN THE ROOM THE
FURNITURE ALL VERY OLD AND OF YELLOW WOOD CONSISTED OF A SOFA WITH
A HUGE BENT WOODEN BACK AN OVAL TABLE IN FRONT OF THE SOFA A
DRESSING TABLE WITH A LOOKING GLASS FIXED ON IT BETWEEN THE WINDOWS
CHAIRS ALONG THE WALLS AND TWO OR THREE HALF PENNY PRINTS IN YELLOW
FRAMES REPRESENTING GERMAN DAMSELS WITH BIRDS IN THEIR HANDS  THAT WAS
ALL IN THE CORNER A LIGHT WAS BURNING BEFORE A SMALL IKON EVERYTHING
WAS VERY CLEAN  THE FLOOR AND THE FURNITURE WERE BRIGHTLY POLISHED 
EVERYTHING SHONE

LIZAVETAS WORK THOUGHT THE YOUNG MAN THERE WAS NOT A SPECK OF DUST
TO BE SEEN IN THE WHOLE FLAT

ITS IN THE HOUSES OF SPITEFUL OLD WIDOWS THAT ONE FINDS SUCH
CLEANLINESS RASKOLNIKOV THOUGHT AGAIN AND HE STOLE A CURIOUS GLANCE
AT THE COTTON CURTAIN OVER THE DOOR LEADING INTO ANOTHER TINY ROOM IN
WHICH STOOD THE OLD WOMANS BED AND CHEST OF DRAWERS AND INTO WHICH HE
HAD NEVER LOOKED BEFORE THESE TWO ROOMS MADE UP THE WHOLE FLAT

WHAT DO YOU WANT THE OLD WOMAN SAID SEVERELY COMING INTO THE ROOM
AND AS BEFORE STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM SO AS TO LOOK HIM STRAIGHT IN
THE FACE

IVE BROUGHT SOMETHING TO PAWN HERE AND HE DREW OUT OF HIS POCKET
AN OLD FASHIONED FLAT SILVER WATCH ON THE BACK OF WHICH WAS ENGRAVED A
GLOBE  THE CHAIN WAS OF STEEL

BUT THE TIME IS UP FOR YOUR LAST PLEDGE THE MONTH WAS UP THE DAY

YOUNG MAN TOOK IT AND WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE WAS ON THE POINT OF GOING
AWAY  BUT CHECKED HIMSELF AT ONCE REMEMBERING THAT THERE WAS NOWHERE
ELSE HE COULD GO AND THAT HE HAD HAD ANOTHER OBJECT ALSO IN COMING

HAND IT OVER HE SAID ROUGHLY

THE OLD WOMAN FUMBLED IN HER POCKET FOR HER KEYS AND DISAPPEARED BEHIND
THE CURTAIN INTO THE OTHER ROOM THE YOUNG MAN LEFT STANDING ALONE IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM LISTENED INQUISITIVELY THINKING HE COULD HEAR
HER UNLOCKING THE CHEST OF DRAWERS

IT MUST BE THE TOP DRAWER HE REFLECTED SO SHE CARRIES THE KEYS IN
A POCKET ON THE RIGHT ALL IN ONE BUNCH ON A STEEL RING AND THERES
ONE KEY THERE THREE TIMES AS BIG AS ALL THE OTHERS WITH DEEP NOTCHES 
THAT CANT BE THE KEY OF THE CHEST OF DRAWERS THEN THERE MUST BE SOME

PASSAGE

WHAT BUSINESS IS SHE OF YOURS MY GOOD SIR

OH NOTHING PARTICULAR I SIMPLY ASKED YOU ARE TOO QUICK GOOD DAY
ALYONA IVANOVNA

RASKOLNIKOV WENT OUT IN COMPLETE CONFUSION THIS CONFUSION BECAME MORE
AND MORE INTENSE AS HE WENT DOWN THE STAIRS HE EVEN STOPPED SHORT TWO
OR THREE TIMES AS THOUGH SUDDENLY STRUCK BY SOME THOUGHT WHEN HE WAS
IN THE STREET HE CRIED OUT OH GOD HOW LOATHSOME IT ALL IS AND
CAN I CAN I POSSIBLY NO ITS NONSENSE ITS RUBBISH HE ADDED
RESOLUTELY AND HOW COULD SUCH AN ATROCIOUS THING COME INTO MY HEAD
WHAT FILTHY THINGS MY HEART IS CAPABLE OF YES FILTHY ABOVE ALL
DISGUSTING LOATHSOME LOATHSOME  AND FOR A WHOLE MONTH IVE BEEN
BUT NO WORDS NO EXCLAMATIONS COULD EXPRESS HIS AGITATION THE FEELING
OF INTENSE REPULSION WHICH HAD BEGUN TO OPPRESS AND TORTURE HIS HEART
WHILE HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO THE OLD WOMAN HAD BY NOW REACHED SUCH A
PITCH AND HAD TAKEN SUCH A DEFINITE FORM THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO
DO WITH HIMSELF TO ESCAPE FROM HIS WRETCHEDNESS HE WALKED ALONG THE
PAVEMENT LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN REGARDLESS OF THE PASSERS BY AND JOSTLING
AGAINST THEM AND ONLY CAME TO HIS SENSES WHEN HE WAS IN THE NEXT
STREET LOOKING ROUND HE NOTICED THAT HE WAS STANDING CLOSE TO A TAVERN
WHICH WAS ENTERED BY STEPS LEADING FROM THE PAVEMENT TO THE BASEMENT
AT THAT INSTANT TWO DRUNKEN MEN CAME OUT AT THE DOOR AND ABUSING AND
SUPPORTING ONE ANOTHER THEY MOUNTED THE STEPS WITHOUT STOPPING TO
THINK RASKOLNIKOV WENT DOWN THE STEPS AT ONCE TILL THAT MOMENT HE HAD
NEVER BEEN INTO A TAVERN BUT NOW HE FELT GIDDY AND WAS TORMENTED BY A
BURNING THIRST HE LONGED FOR A DRINK OF COLD BEER AND ATTRIBUTED HIS
SUDDEN WEAKNESS TO THE WANT OF FOOD HE SAT DOWN AT A STICKY LITTLE
TABLE IN A DARK AND DIRTY CORNER  ORDERED SOME BEER AND EAGERLY DRANK
OFF THE FIRST GLASSFUL AT ONCE HE FELT EASIER  AND HIS THOUGHTS BECAME
CLEAR

ALL THATS NONSENSE HE SAID HOPEFULLY AND THERE IS NOTHING IN IT
ALL TO WORRY ABOUT ITS SIMPLY PHYSICAL DERANGEMENT JUST A GLASS OF
BEER A PIECE OF DRY BREAD  AND IN ONE MOMENT THE BRAIN IS STRONGER
THE MIND IS CLEARER AND THE WILL IS FIRM PHEW HOW UTTERLY PETTY IT ALL
IS

BUT IN SPITE OF THIS SCORNFUL REFLECTION HE WAS BY NOW LOOKING CHEERFUL
AS THOUGH HE WERE SUDDENLY SET FREE FROM A TERRIBLE BURDEN AND HE GAZED
ROUND IN A FRIENDLY WAY AT THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM BUT EVEN AT THAT
MOMENT HE HAD A DIM FOREBODING THAT THIS HAPPIER FRAME OF MIND WAS ALSO
NOT NORMAL THERE WERE FEW PEOPLE AT THE TIME IN THE TAVERN BESIDES THE TWO DRUNKEN
MEN HE HAD MET ON THE STEPS A GROUP CONSISTING OF ABOUT FIVE MEN AND
A GIRL WITH A CONCERTINA HAD GONE OUT AT THE SAME TIME THEIR DEPARTURE
LEFT THE ROOM QUIET AND RATHER EMPTY THE PERSONS STILL IN THE TAVERN
WERE A MAN WHO APPEARED TO BE AN ARTISAN DRUNK BUT NOT EXTREMELY SO
SITTING BEFORE A POT OF BEER AND HIS COMPANION A HUGE STOUT MAN WITH
A GREY BEARD IN A SHORT FULL SKIRTED COAT HE WAS VERY DRUNK AND HAD
DROPPED ASLEEP ON THE BENCH  EVERY NOW AND THEN HE BEGAN AS THOUGH IN
HIS SLEEP CRACKING HIS FINGERS WITH HIS ARMS WIDE APART AND THE UPPER
PART OF HIS BODY BOUNDING ABOUT ON THE BENCH WHILE HE HUMMED SOME
MEANINGLESS REFRAIN TRYING TO RECALL SOME SUCH LINES AS THESE

   HIS WIFE A YEAR HE FONDLY LOVED
    HIS WIFE A  A YEAR HE  FONDLY LOVED

OR SUDDENLY WAKING UP AGAIN

   WALKING ALONG THE CROWDED ROW
    HE MET THE ONE HE USED TO KNOW

BUT NO ONE SHARED HIS ENJOYMENT HIS SILENT COMPANION LOOKED WITH
POSITIVE HOSTILITY AND MISTRUST AT ALL THESE MANIFESTATIONS THERE WAS
ANOTHER MAN IN THE ROOM WHO LOOKED SOMEWHAT LIKE A RETIRED GOVERNMENT
CLERK HE WAS SITTING APART NOW AND THEN SIPPING FROM HIS POT AND
LOOKING ROUND AT THE COMPANY HE TOO APPEARED TO BE IN SOME AGITATION
